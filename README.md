The idea behind Raincloud plots was introduced by [Micah Allen on his blog](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/). My coworkers and I found it really interesting to display our data but they did not have any R experience, so I made this shiny app to provide a smooth transition to R and ggplot.

## Citing RainCloudPlots
